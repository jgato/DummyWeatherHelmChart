# Dummy weather prediction service

It is just a dummy/simple Helm Chart I use for testing. It is based on a [dummy/simple REST service](https://github.com/jgato/DummyWeather) that does pretty much nothing


## Needed parameters to run

These are the required parameters to be filled in the deployment form:

- The number of **replicas** of the service to be deployed.
